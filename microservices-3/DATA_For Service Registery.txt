Code :

1. Create new project and have eureka server dependency

		<dependency>
			<groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
			<artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-netflix-eureka-server</artifactId>
		</dependency>

2. In main Springboot class

add @EnableEurekaServer on class level

3. In application.yml file

eureka:
  client:
    register-with-eureka: false
    fetch-registry: false
server:
  port: 8761

because this is not our client, this is our server. That's why we are making the above changes.
and 8761 is default port of eureak. So we will keep same

Run the server and we will get "http://localhost:8761/"


++++++-----

1.In both payment and order service

2.First add Depnedency and then annotate main class with @EnableEurekaServer 

3.then application.yml file

  application:
    name: ORDER-SERVICE

eureka:
  client:
    register-with-eureka: true
    fetch-registry: true
    service-url:
      defaultZone: http://localhost:8761/eureka/
  instance:
    hostname: localhost 

and also add application Name

spring:
  application:
    name: ORDER-SERVICE 

4. Now update the hardcoded value that we have added in the last project to call the payment-service
	So,add our new code will look like
				Payment paymentResponse = restTemplate.postForObject("http://PAYMENT-SERVICE/Payment/SavePayment",
									payment, Payment.class);
5. up all the services and hit the below URL again, and we wil see the services are up
http://localhost:8761/

6. Add @LoadBalanced on the top of RestTemplate. So, our new code will be like 

	@Bean
	@LoadBalanced
	public RestTemplate restTemplate() {
		return new RestTemplate();
	}
